Sure! Let me explain each part of the code:

## Package Declaration
**`package main`** - This declares that this file belongs to the "main" package. In Go, the main package is special because it creates an executable program rather than a library. Every Go program that you want to run directly must have a main package.

## Import Statement
**`import "fmt"`** - This imports the fmt (format) package from Go's standard library. The fmt package provides functions for formatted input/output operations, like printing to the console, reading user input, and formatting strings.

## Main Function
**`func main()`** - This is the entry point of your program. When you run a Go program, execution starts here. It's like the starting line of your program where everything begins.

## Variable Declaration
**`var a int = 10`** - This is an explicit way to declare a variable in Go:
- `var` is the keyword that tells Go you're declaring a variable
- `a` is the variable name
- `int` explicitly specifies the data type (integer)
- `= 10` initializes the variable with the value 10

The commented line `//a := 10` shows the short declaration syntax, which is more concise and lets Go automatically infer the type.

## Constant Declaration
**`const p = 100`** - This declares a constant:
- `const` keyword indicates this value cannot be changed after declaration
- `p` is the constant name
- `= 100` sets its value
- Once set, you cannot modify `p` anywhere in the program

## Print Statements
**`fmt.Println(a)` and `fmt.Println(p)`** - These print the values to the console:
- `fmt.Println` is a function from the fmt package
- It prints the value followed by a newline
- First prints the variable `a` (10), then the constant `p` (100)
